# Figma Plugin Prefomance Test 🧪⚡️

Simple test to experiment with perfomance under different conditions.

The idea is simple, we tried to count to a big number as fast as possible and compare performance.

Does the UI freeze? Is Main vs UI faster? Is it faster to use WASM in C++ or Rust? Web Workers?

# Run

`yarn watch`
